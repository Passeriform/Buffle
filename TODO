☐ Add configuration handler for palette, sizing, game speed, pattern stencil swap

Recommendations:
    ☐ Raised blocks for visual clarity
    ☐ Add powers for >3 matches and match patterns
    ☐ Add how to play screen

Naming:
    ☐ Blocks can be pattern/glyph based to avoid 2 -> 4 confusion when merging 3 of the same
    ☐ Blocks can be numbered 2, 6, 18, ... but that will be more confusing
